This project is made for my convenience only to test various OpenCV examples that were referenced from many internet site shared their source codes easily with help of CMake and it is for testing purpose only.

If there is any pirating in source code here, then that is not my intention and let me know to delete it upon request.

In the project, there are several examples and below is the list.
In future, there will be more useful examples included.

1. [dybanicrange] 	Drawing histogram from input image
2. [houghlines]		Detecting lines from input image under threshold control
3. [quadrilateral]	Reconstruction of quadrilateral object in 2D
4. [surfeature]		Testing SURF
5. [transform]		Real time object tracking (from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSeFrPrqZ2A)
